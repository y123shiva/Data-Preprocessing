Checking the Presence of Missing Values in titanic
Fill the null values of the Age column. Fill mean Survived age(mean age of the survived people) in the column where the person has survived and mean not Survived age (mean age of the people who have not survived) in the column where person has not survived
Fill mean Survived age(mean age of the survived people) in the column where the person has survived
Fill Mean Not Survived Age (mean age of the people who have not survived) in the column where person has not survived
Now, We find that the Age column has no missing vlaue present.
We want to check if "Embarked" column is is important for analysis or not, that is whether survival of the person depends on the Embarked column value or not
